# Learner Churn Analysis Project 📚

## Overview
This project predicts learner churn (students dropping out) on an online learning platform.  
The workflow covers **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **predictive modeling** to identify learners at risk of dropping out early.

---

## Problem Statement
- Learners start courses highly motivated, but many drop out unexpectedly.  
- 31.8% of learners withdraw silently, with no clear indicators, making intervention difficult.  
- Dropouts are influenced by **personal, academic, and platform-related factors**.  
- High enrollments but low completions highlight the need for **predictive solutions to detect at-risk learners early**.

## Model Building & Evaluation
- **Feature Selection:** Removed status-based features and checked correlations to avoid data leakage  
- **Models Tested:** Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost  
- **Final Model:** Gradient Boosting Classifier — **Accuracy: 91%**, **F1-Score: 0.86**

## Key Results & Recommendations

### Insights
- Delayed first application and long courses → higher dropout risk  
- Engagement metrics, regional application rate, and opportunity choices affect churn  

### Recommendations
- Personalized onboarding and early interventions  
- Restructure courses into weekly modules  
- Develop region-specific content and community hubs  
- Improve recommendation algorithm and use AI prompts to re-engage learners
